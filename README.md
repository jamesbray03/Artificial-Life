# Cellular Automata Simulation

Dive into the mesmerizing world of Cellular Automata Simulation, where simple rules lead to complex and beautiful patterns. This interactive simulation allows you to explore the fascinating behavior of cellular automata through a visually engaging and dynamic display.

## Overview of Controls:
- **Auto-Run Toggle:** Automatically updates the simulation continuously.
- **Draw Toggle:** Enables you to draw or erase in the simulation space (use left and right click).
- **Brush Size:** Changes the radius of your cursor for drawing.
- **FPS Slider:** Adjusts the frame rate to control the speed of the simulation.
- **Growth Rate Slider:** Modifies the speed at which cells grow and spread.
- **Growth Mean Slider:** Alters the mean value of the growth distribution.
- **Growth Distribution Slider:** Changes the standard deviation of the growth distribution, affecting the randomness of cell growth.
- **Kernel Size Slider:** Adjusts the size of the influence kernel, determining how far a cell’s influence extends.
- **Kernel Mean Slider:** Modifies the mean value of the kernel’s influence distribution.
- **Kernel Distribution Slider:** Changes the kernel’s influence distribution's standard deviation, affecting the influence's spread.

Explore different configurations using the sliders to see how tiny changes can lead to dramatically different outcomes in this captivating cellular automata simulation.
