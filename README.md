Dive into the mesmerizing world of Cellular Automata Simulation, where simple rules lead to complex and beautiful patterns. This interactive simulation allows you to explore the fascinating behaviour of cellular automata through a visually engaging and dynamic display.

### Overview of Controls:
- Auto-Run Toggle: Automatically updates the simulation continuously.
- FPS Slider: Adjusts the frame rate to control the speed of the simulation.
- Growth Rate Slider: Modifies the speed at which cells grow and spread.
- Growth Mean Slider: Alters the mean value of the growth distribution.
- Growth Distribution Slider: Changes the standard deviation of the growth distribution, affecting the randomness of cell growth.
- Kernel Size Slider: Adjusts the size of the influence kernel, determining how far a cell’s influence extends.
- Kernel Mean Slider: Modifies the mean value of the kernel’s influence distribution.
Kernel Distribution Slider: Changes the standard deviation of the kernel’s influence distribution, affecting the spread of influence.
Explore different configurations using the sliders to see how tiny changes can lead to dramatically different outcomes in this captivating cellular automata simulation.
